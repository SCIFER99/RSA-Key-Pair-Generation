# RSA-Key-Pair-Generation
This script was designed to generate RSA Key Pairs in PKI development. 

Hey! I wish you all a happy holidays where ever you are! Cryptography is my field of study and I love it! 

Step1: Make sure to install these packages before PKI project development:

       pip3 install os
       pip3 install sys
       pip3 install pytest
       pip3 install shutil
       pip3 install glob (or iglob)
       pip3 install tempfile
       pip3 install requests
       pip3 install crypto
       pip3 install RNG
       
Step2: In case the RNG package does not install properly, I have provided the RNG package files separately for manual installation!

Happy Coding!
